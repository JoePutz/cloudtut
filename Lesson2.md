AWS Architecture
it's infrastructure is divided into the following categories: regions and availability zones
you can choose region and availability zones which can be accessed from everywhere
so long as you are within an availability zone can access basically any region. I thinkg. 


DOMAINS of AWS
Compute: EC2? elastic cloud compute
a raw server to host website. 
It is a clean slate. Basically 

elastic beanstalk: don't have to worry about underlying architecture. predefined libraries
just use the libraries, has a defined underlying architecture

migration: allows to physically move data to data center
AWS has snowball to allow this migration

Security and compliance: 

Storage: many services
S3: storage place is called bucket, and files
cloudfront: content delivery network
Glacier: place to store archives, very affordable

Networking: 
VPC and direct connect, 
VPC: virtual network that lets you move or launch 
direct connection: 

Messaging: secure messaging
cloud trial and optionworks all things that allow messaging

Databases: not the same as storage. 
SQL-like and SQL options. claims 5x faster than usual
non-delational DBNS? 

Management Tool: cloudwatch sets alarms and other things to help w/ management



AWS FREE TIER
beginners should start there. Accessable for 12 months. free. but limited in how it is used. What AWS does is it gives services for free, but will charge if you go over the limits. Should be good for learning services. 

It also has videos to help create account and whatnot. 
Requires credit card details
