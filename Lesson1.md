WHAT IS CLOUD ENGINEERING?

What was before Cloud? 
Before hosting a website needed to buy servers. Which cost money
Traffic was not constant throughout the day
Monitoring and maintaining servers was problematic

This led to disadvantages: 
1 Costly. 
2 Troubleshooting was a big issue. Tediuous and time consuming. 
3 Traffic varies and idle most of the time. But you had to predict how many servers you used at different times. Which could be problematic if things were more or less than usual. Waste money if less, can't help customers if more
4 Data was limited in how much it could be. Now it's too much

What is cloud: 
A huge space. A collection of data centers. 
Allowed the management of resources by combinign all data servers together. So basically combined a lot of servers to network together. Now it could rent the services needed and save money. 
These services could take care of most of the monitoring and maintaining themselves. 

Cloud computing is: 
- Storing data/applications on remote servers
- Processing data/applications from servers
- Accessing data/applications via internet

Service Models: 
iaaS
PaaS
SaaS

WHAT IS SaaS:
Software as a Service
leasing software that is owned and handled by someone else
Gmail is an example. You use the service that is there. You do not have to do anything, Google manages everything

WHAT IS PaaS
Platform as a Service
Ex. Google App Engine
The Cloud Provider gives the ability to the customer to deploy custom created apps using programming languages, tools, etc. that are provided by the Cloud Provider. 
No control of underlying data structure

WHAT IS IaaS? 
Infrastructure as a Service
Provides virtual computing resources over the internet
no worries about the underlying physical machine
Abstract the user from the physical machine


In IaaS you manage: Data, Applications, Runtime, MOdelware, O/S
In Iaas vendor manages: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

In PaaS you manage: Data, Applications
In PaaS vendor manages: Runtime, MOdelware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking

In SaaS you manage: Data
vendor manages: everything else



DEPLOYMENT MODELS
types of clouds

Public Cloud
Private Cloud


Public Cloud: 
service provider makes resources, such as application and storage, available to general public
easy and inexpensive set-up behind hardware, application, and bandwidth costs are covered by provider
no wasted resources, you pay for what you use 

Private Cloud:
Offers hosted services to a limited # of people behind firewall, minimizes security concerns
Private cloud gives companies direct control over their data

Hybrid Cloud: 
a computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and 3rd party, public cloud services



Cloud Providers
Since cloud came into existences mnay bourthgt a lot and rented them to others

Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, IBM Cloud, DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, terremark

AWS is generally regarded as the best, but there are others that do some different things
GCP does some different things to make its power more efficient.
